## Problem description

SRE specialists need to integrate and use many tools to get things done. Modern tools are complex and configuring them correctly is not a trivial job. What if you integrate multiple tools with each of them having inconsistencies in setup? Number of errors can increase exponentially.

How can this be avoided? There are some options ðŸ’¡:

1. Read all the docs of all the tools you use and attempt to configure everything as described. But honestly, who has time for this? ðŸ™„

2. Hire an experienced engineer to help you with settings and future maintenance. But again, what about the cost? ðŸ’²

3. Use SREnity to scan your DevOps/SRE toolchain in `read-only` mode to get notifications about missing configurations and get recommendations how to fix them. Sounds quick and affordable, right? ðŸ˜Š

Awesome!
